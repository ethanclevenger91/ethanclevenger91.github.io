title: Jekyll?

[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) is a static-site generator - great for fast websites that can still do some of the fancy stuff CMSs do. So I figured I would try it out for my development blog since it's built into GitHub pages. If nothing else, it's a great excuse to learn a new technology and get more familiar with markdown. I'll be following up with my build proces for local testing.
