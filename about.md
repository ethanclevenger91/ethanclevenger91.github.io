My name is Ethan Clevenger. Iâ€™m a web developer in Des Moines, IA. I graduated from Drake University in 2014 with a degree in computer science, so I've at least played with a lot of languages and technologies - PHP, HTML, CSS, Javascript + jQuery, Java, C++, Objective-C, Android...

This is my blog, where you'll largely see articles related to the stuff I do at work - web, WordPress, Yii. You'll also see my love for build tools and package managers creep out. Check back often.
